# Block Linear Algebra Algorithms

This file collection contains prototype realizations of linear algebra algorithms. All algorithms are expressed as block or tile algorithms, meaning that the bulk of the computation corresponds to matrix-matrix multiplications (level-3 BLAS).

 * Cholesky decomposition
 * QR decomposition
 * RQ decomposition
 * Eigenvalue reordering in a Schur decomposition
 * LU decomposition
